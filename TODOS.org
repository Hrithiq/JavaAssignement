* Inventory management project
Things to ponder on: Is maven allowed, and if so, are external libraries allowed?
If no, we can use our own csv parser, else we use a database driver.

Do we create a GUI, or a terminal based app?
** TODO 2 users: Manager and Customer
- [ ] Dashboard for Manager.
** TODO Notification Service
** TODO Saving information
All of the inventory information will be saved in files, hopefully .csv.
** TODO Documentation
I propose we use [[https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#format][javadoc]]. It is a supported tool by oracle widely used in the industry
** TODO Dashboard (Urja)
 1) Ask the user if they want to log in, or create new user.
    - Create new user: Call appropriate method.
    - Login: Get the UserRow(class) ManagerRow(class) from sql
* Optional Features
- GUI with javafx
